# Part 5: Advanced State Tracking

Games with lots of interaction can get very complex, very quickly and the writer's job is often as much about maintaining continuity as it is about content.

This becomes particularly important if the game text is intended to model anything - whether it's a game of cards, the player's knowledge of the gameworld so far, or the state of the various light-switches in a house.

**ink** does not provide a full world-modelling system in the manner of a classic parser IF authoring language - there are no "objects", no concepts of "containment" or being "open" or "locked". However, it does provide a simple yet powerful system for tracking state-changes in a very flexible way, to enable writers to approximate world models where necessary.

#### Note: New feature alert!

This feature is very new to the language. That means we haven't begun to discover all the ways it might be used - but we're pretty sure it's going to be useful! So if you think of a clever usage we'd love to know!
