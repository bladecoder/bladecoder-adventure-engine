Bladecoder Adventure Engine
===========================

Bladecoder Adventure Engine is a set of tools to create interactive graphic adventures (classical point ant click games).

I think that this type of games is a great medium to tell stories and the new mobile devices provides a big opportunity to rebird and evolve them.

By creating Bladecoder Adventure Engine, I want to create a platform to tell stories. Interactive stories with modern graphics, animations and music.

### The Goddess Robbery

Bladecoder Adventure Engine is currently under development and it is not ready for production. The Goddess Robbery is a test game created to show the features of the Engine.

The Goddess Robbery is currently available for Android devices at the Google Play Store.
